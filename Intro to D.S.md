**What is discrete math?**
- essentially math for CS 

Math has two parts: Continuous and Discrete

**Continuous is the math that I have all ready learned:**
- Trigonometry
- Calculus
- Algebra
i.g working with real numbers fractional or whole

**Discrete math includes:**
- Combinatorics
- Graph theory
- Number theory
- Logic
- Abstract algebra (not a complete list)
D.S is mostly working with integers, as in whole countable numbers.

**Why is this course useful?**
- learn to translate problems into solutions when presented in a natural language (programming language, protocol, etc)
- useful in designing systems in CS
	- networks + security
	- databases
	- cryptography
	- web dev
- Different ways to create and store information
