| Symbol          | Operator                 | Meaning                                                                       |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $$( A \cup B)$$  | Union                    | The set of all elements that are in \( A \) or in \( B \) or in both.         |
| $$( A \cap B )$$  | Intersection             | The set of all elements that are in both \( A \) and \( B \).                  |
| $$( A \setminus B )$$ | Set Difference       | The set of all elements that are in \( A \) but not in \( B \).                |
| $$( A \subseteq B )$$ | Subset                | Every element of \( A \) is also an element of \( B \) (may be equal).         |
| $$( A \subset B )$$   | Proper Subset         | Every element of \( A \) is also an element of \( B \) but \( A \) is not equal to \( B \). |
| $$( A \supseteq B)$$ | Superset              | Every element of \( B \) is also an element of \( A \) (may be equal).         |
| $$( A \supset B)$$   | Proper Superset       | Every element of \( B \) is also an element of \( A \) but \( A \) is not equal to \( B \). |
| $$( A = B )$$         | Equality              | Sets \( A \) and \( B \) contain exactly the same elements.                    |
| $$( A \neq B)$$      | Inequality            | Sets \( A \) and \( B \) do not contain exactly the same elements.             |
| $$ \emptyset $$     | Empty Set             | The set containing no elements.                                                |
| $$ \forall $$       | For all               | Denotes universal quantification, meaning "for all" or "for every".             |
| $$ \exists$$       | There exists          | Denotes existential quantification, meaning "there exists" or "there is".       |
| $$ \cup $$          | General Union         | Union of a collection of sets.                                                  |
| $$\cap$$          | General Intersection  | Intersection of a collection of sets.                                           |
| $$ \bigcup $$       | Union of Sets         | Union of all elements in a collection of sets.                                  |
