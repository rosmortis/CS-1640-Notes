## Example

**In English**
If you enter the correct password, then you can log into the network.
You enter the correct password 
Therefore, can log into the network

**In Logic**
p : you enter the correct password
q: you can log into the network

$$
\begin{align*}
&\quad (1) p \to q \\
&\quad (2) p \\
\hline
&\quad \therefore q \\
\end{align*}
$$
Can write in one line: 
$$
(p \to q) \land p \to q
$$
