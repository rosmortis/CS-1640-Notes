# General Form of a Proof

1) clearly stating what is to be proven (include quantifiers, domain, conditional statement)
2) body of proof - argument
	1) Given statements / assumptions (hypothesis)
	2) Definitions
	3) Axioms (statements we assume to be true)
	4) laws of logic
	5) rules of inference
3) Conclusion (Therefore,...) or Q.E.D $\qed$ 

# Types of proofs
- Direct proof
- Indirect proof
- Proof by contrapositive
- Proof by Contradiction
- Proof by cases
- Proof by exhaustion

# Direct Proof
Proving $p \to q$ or $\forall x (P(x) \to Q(x))$ or $\forall x \forall y (p(x,y) \to Q(x,y))$

Idea of a direct proof: Assume p is tre, show that
