## Sets
- A collection of objects, called elements or members (order does not matter)
## Three ways to define a set:
 1. Description in English
	- A = multiplies of 5 from 10 to 30
 2. Roster notation / listing the elements as comma delimited list, enclosed by curly braces
	- A = {10, 15, 20, 25, 30}
	- B = {2, 4, 6, ... , 100}
	- C = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...}
 3. Set builder notation / most mathematical most structured
	- {X | property the elements must follow}
	- {X e S | property the elements must follow}
	-  A = {n Є z |
## Venn diagram
- A way to visualize two or three sets and how they overlap(intersect)
	-  U = {1, 2, 3, ..., 12} (universal set)
	- D = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10}
	- E = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}
	
| D |  | E | In U but not D or E |
	| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
	| 1, 3, 5, 9 | 2, 8, 10 | 4, 6, 12 | 7, 11 |
## More Notation
Є = is element of
⊂ = is a proper subset of
⊆ = is a sub set of
$\mathbb{Z}$ = set of integers
**R** = set of real numbers
$\mathbb{R}^+$ = set of real positive numbers
$\mathbb{N}$ = Natural numbers
$\mathbb{Q}$ = Rational numbers
$\mathbb{P}$ = Irrational 
∩ = Intersection (the set of all elements)
U = union (elements both have)
λ = string with length 0
### In Use
A = {10, 15, 20, 25, 30} 
B = {20, 30}
10 Є A
B ⊂ A every element in B is in A
B ⊆ A 
| A | = cardinality of a set / number of elements
Ø or { } = empty set or the set of no elements

## Set Rules
**N ⊂ Z ⊂ Q ⊂ R**
X and Y are sets if X ⊆ Y, then X ⊂ Y
