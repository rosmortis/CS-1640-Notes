# Graphs
Discrete graphs (not continuous)
Represented by nodes or vertices and edges
discrete graphs are a conceptual image, not spatially oriented
can also be called combinatorial

Given by two sets the node set, a list of single values and a set of edges made up of smaller sets of two values from the node set

If two vertices are connected by an edge then they are neighbors
The degree of a node is how many edges it has going to it
# Trees
A tree is graph that does not contain a cycle. 
A cycles is a sequence of nodes and edges that start and end at the same node.
a connected tree is when all the nodes are mapped to by one edge
a connected tree with n nodes has n-1 edges

A rooted tree is where one node is labeled root and is the parent of all the other elements

Binairy tree is when each node has at leat one node
